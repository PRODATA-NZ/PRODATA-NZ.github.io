In business terms, a Dependency Injector is a software design pattern that helps to reduce the dependencies between different components of an application. In simpler terms, it is a tool that helps to separate the different parts of an application so that they can be developed and maintained independently of one another.

The key benefit of using a Dependency Injector is that it allows for easier maintenance and flexibility of an application. By decoupling components, changes to one component will not require changes to other components, making it easier to modify and maintain the application. This also allows for greater reuse of code, as components can be easily swapped out or reused in different parts of the application.

Another benefit of Dependency Injection is that it makes it easier to test an application. By injecting dependencies into a component, it is possible to mock those dependencies in order to test the component in isolation, without having to test the entire application. This can help to identify bugs and issues more quickly, and make it easier to maintain and improve the quality of the application over time.

However, there are also some cons to using Dependency Injection. It can make the application more complex and harder to understand, as there are more moving parts that need to be managed. Additionally, it can be more difficult to set up and configure, as dependencies need to be defined and managed at runtime.

Overall, the pros of using a Dependency Injector outweigh the cons, as it can make it easier to develop, maintain, and test an application, and can lead to better overall quality and flexibility.
